# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Usage: helm install full-stack-app ./k8s-helm -f values-dev.yaml
# 
# This configuration optimizes for:
# - Lower resource usage (suitable for local development)
# - Faster startup times
# - Minimal storage requirements

# =============================================================================
# REDUCED RESOURCES FOR DEVELOPMENT
# =============================================================================
resources:
  backend:
    requests:
      memory: "64Mi"   # Half of production
      cpu: "50m"       # Minimal CPU
    limits:
      memory: "256Mi"  # Reasonable limit for dev
      cpu: "250m"      # Quarter core max
  
  frontend:
    requests:
      memory: "16Mi"   # Very lightweight
      cpu: "10m"       # Minimal CPU
    limits:
      memory: "32Mi"   # Small limit
      cpu: "50m"       # Sufficient for dev
  
  mongodb:
    requests:
      memory: "128Mi"  # Half of production
      cpu: "100m"      # Reduced CPU
    limits:
      memory: "512Mi"  # Reasonable for dev data
      cpu: "500m"      # Half core max

# DEVELOPMENT STORAGE
# =============================================================================
mongodb:
  storage:
    size: 1Gi  # Smaller storage for development data
